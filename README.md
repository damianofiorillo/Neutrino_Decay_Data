# Neutrino_Decay_Data

Plotting scripts to generate and plot the present and projected joint two-dimensional bounds on neutrino lifetimes, from Figs. 5 and 6 of the paper *Neutrino decay in the cosmic high-energy diffuse and point-source fluxes* [arXiv:XXXX.XXXXX](http://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.XXXXX).  

Also contains the pre-computed digitized contours for reusing them elsewhere.

## How to use the code

### To import the pre-computed neutrino lifetime contours

The 95% C.L. pre-computed contours of disfavored $\tau_3/m_3$ vs.~$\tau_2/m_2$ shown in Figs. 5 and 6 of XXXX.XXXXX are stored in the folder `digitized_contours/`. Open the notebook `ImportingDigitizedContours.ipynb` to find how to import and plot them. This notebook simply __plots__ the pre-computed contours; to __generate__ them, see below.

### To generate new neutrino lifetime contours

The notebook `PlottingScript.ipnyb` contains code to generate the contours of disfavored $\tau_3/m_3$ vs.~$\tau_2/m_2$ using the pre-computed likelihood data stored in the folder `likelihood_data/`.  By default, the code generates the contours at 95% C.L., but the user can change this.

This notebook also contains code to generate Figs. 5 and 6 of XXXX.XXXX.
